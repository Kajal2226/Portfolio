        <h2>Projects</h2>

        <div class="project">
            <h3>1. Stellar Galaxy Classification Model using CNN</h3>
            <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Developed a deep learning model to classify stellar objects, specifically stars and galaxies, using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This project was initiated as part of a collaborative effort with Aryabhatta Research Institute of Observational Sciences (ARIES), utilizing image cutouts obtained from their in-house 1.3m telescope.</p>
            <p><strong>Technologies Used:</strong> Python, TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV</p>
            <p><strong>Details:</strong> The project involved preprocessing and augmenting a dataset of 64x64 pixel images of stars and galaxies. The CNN model was trained to distinguish between these classes with high accuracy. Advanced techniques such as dropout, batch normalization, and data augmentation were implemented to optimize the model's performance. The final model demonstrated robust accuracy and was able to generalize well on unseen data.</p>
            <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> The model achieved an accuracy of over 90% on the test dataset, making it a reliable tool for astronomical object classification. This work contributes to the field of astrophysics by aiding in the automated classification of celestial bodies.</p>

        <div class="project">
            <h3>2. Virtual Trial Room Project using Deep Learning</h3>
            <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Designed and developed a virtual trial room application that allows users to virtually try on clothes using computer vision and deep learning techniques. This innovative project combines fashion technology with AI to enhance the online shopping experience.</p>
            <p><strong>Technologies Used:</strong> Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow, Tkinter (for GUI)</p>
            <p><strong>Details:</strong> The project involved detecting body parts using pose estimation algorithms and mapping clothing items onto the user’s image. The application was built with a user-friendly interface using Tkinter, and deep learning models were used to ensure that the clothing fit accurately based on the user's body shape. The solution integrates real-time image processing with machine learning to create a seamless virtual dressing experience.</p>
            <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Successfully created a working prototype that was able to realistically fit clothing items onto the user’s body in real-time, making it a valuable tool for online retail.</p>

The model analyzes captions and comments to determine whether the content is relatable and to provide feedback.</p>
            <p><strong>Technologies Used:</strong> Python, TensorFlow, Keras, Natural Language Processing (NLP)</p>
            <p><strong>Details:</strong> The project involved collecting and preprocessing text data, including tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization. The ANN model was trained on labeled data to classify sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral. The model was fine-tuned using various optimization techniques to improve accuracy and generalization.</p>
            <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> The sentiment analysis model demonstrated high accuracy in classifying sentiments, making it a useful tool for brands and individuals looking to gauge public perception and sentiment trends on social media platforms.</p>
